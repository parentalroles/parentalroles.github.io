We model parental roles using agent based simulation models. 
This is a simple simulation to predict sex roles in parental care that we would expect to evolve under the specified assumptions.

The model follows game-2 of Maynard Smith (1977), but makes the game consistent and incorporates various assumptions about male rematings and partial paternity.

The game assumes an equal number of males and females in the population who pair up with each other to lay their first clutches 
of the season-- the number of eggs laid by the female is Wc (which is also the total number of eggs she lays if she cares of the young).
The female can lay a second clutch (of size Wd-Wc) if she deserts, and we assume that deserting females always get to remate.
There is no third clutch.
