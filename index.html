			<h1>Evolution of Parental Roles</h1>
			<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis is a simple simulation to predict sex roles in parental care that we would expect to evolve under the specified assumptions. The model follows game-2 of Maynard Smith (1977), but makes the game consistent and
				incorporates various assumptions about male rematings and partial paternity. </p>
			<p>The game assumes an equal number of males and females in the population who pair up with each other to lay their first clutches of the season-- the number of eggs laid by the female is Wc (which is also the total number of eggs she lays if she
				cares of the young). The female can lay a second clutch (of size Wd-Wc) if she deserts, and we assume that deserting females always get to remate. There is no third clutch.</p>
			<p>The offspring survival depends on the number of parents caring: V0 with 0 parents caring, V1 with 1 parent (either father or mother) caring and V2 with both parents caring. We require that 0 &lt;/= V0 &lt;/= V1 &lt;/= V2 &lt;/= 1</p>
			<p>Deserting males can have an advantage over caring males in dominating matings for the second clutch-- the extent of this domination is specified by the parameter a which lies between 0 and 1. When a is 0, caring and deserting males are equally
				likely to mate in the second round. When a is 1, deserting males completely exclude caring males from the second round of matings.</p>
			<p>We also allow for females to mate multiply in the first round, and hence males to have only partial paternity of their clutches. The paternity of a caring male is p and that of a deserting male is r. We would expect 0 &lt;/= r &lt;/= p
				&lt;/=1.</p>
			<p>Deserting males could also have an advantage in the extra-pair matings in the population-- the extent of this advantage is specified by b (lying between 0 and 1), which acts similar to the parameter a. When b is 0, caring and deserting males
				are equally likely to father the extra-pair young in the population. When b is 1, deserting males completely exclude caring males from extra-pair matings.</p>
